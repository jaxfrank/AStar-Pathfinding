AStar-Pathfinding
=================
This is a poject that I started working on to create a simplish library that can perform fast pathfinding through the A* Pathfinding algorithm implemented in C++. Currently this project is being developed for educational purposes only and is not recomended for use in a production build of anything. However, once a more full featured version of the source code is made it will hopefully be a very good library for pathfinding and use in fullscale programs.

Features
========
-Pathfinding(of course)
-Four and Eight directional pathfinding on a 2d grid

Planned Features/Additions/To Do's
=====================================
-A "container" to store the path calculted by the PathFinder
-Multiple selectable heuristics with the ability to add custom heuristic calcuations
-A better way of manipulating setting PathNodes data when construting a NodeMap
-Add some math operators to the Vector2i struct to make it a bit more useful/able to do more than store int x and int y
-Add a tie breaking system
